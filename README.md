# Guessing the number game 

# How do we play the game with rules 

This is going to be a simple guessing game where the computer will generate a random number between 1 to 100, and the user has to guess it in 5 attempts.Based on the user’s guess computer will give various hints if the number is high or low. When the user guess matches 
the number computer will print the answer along with the number of attempts.

# Few key elements to remember

only limited tries.

After every attempt it'll provide info whether your guess is too low or too high or correct.

# Creating the code in python

To generate a random number we will use a Python module named random to use this module in our program, we first need to import it.

▪ import random

▪ Next, we will use the random module to generate a number between 1 to 100 and make all guessing it!

Then we will decide the difficulty level and also decides the total number of attempts.

Then everything followed by the code
